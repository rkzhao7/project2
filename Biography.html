      <h1>Ruikun's biography</h1>

      <p>Born on August 3, 2001 in Guangdong, China, under the sign of Leo. Before 2018, he was 17 years old. In his mind, he will never be the same as others, and he has a different life style. Sometimes he is humorous and lively, but sometimes he shows a puzzling coldness. The expression is serious, making people feel inaccessible.Usually, he prefers to be quiet, because he likes a quiet life alone, going to school alone, going home alone, eating alone, and being in a daze.He likes music, no matter where, he likes black, black clothes, black pants, black shoes, black, night! Everything that represents "black".
      </p>
      
      <p>He is 19 this year. In the first year of college, he became obsessed with poetry. "Let life be beautiful like summer flowers And Death like autumn leaves" This is his most impressive verse.This verse made him realize that to live is to be as brilliant as a flower that blooms in summer, donâ€™t let yourself be restrained, let your life be more meaningful......
